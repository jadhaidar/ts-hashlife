# ts-hashlife

Efficient TypeScript implementation of HashLife, an optimized algorithm for simulating Conway's Game of Life with memoization and quadtree-based compression.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ts-hashlife
# or
yarn add ts-hashlife
# or
pnpm add ts-hashlife
```

## Features

- Implements the HashLife algorithm for Conway's Game of Life
- Written in TypeScript with full type definitions
- Supports both Node.js and browser environments
- Highly optimized for simulating large, sparse patterns
- Includes utilities for drawing and importing/exporting Life patterns

## Credits

This implementation is based on [copy/life](https://github.com/copy/life) by Fabian Hemmer, a JavaScript implementation of the HashLife algorithm. The original project provided the foundation and core algorithm that this TypeScript implementation builds upon.
